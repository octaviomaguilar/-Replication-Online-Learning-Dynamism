The only file that needs to be downloaded by the reader is from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics. The file size is too big to keep in my repository. 
Please visit this url: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm and download the May 2019 national file. 
Convert it to a STATA dta file then store and name it here: "data/oes/nat4d_2019.dta".

This folder should be empty. I do not include the raw QWI files due to its large size. You will need to download the data yourself and place it into this directory. 
To download the data please visit the QWI LED website: https://ledextract.ces.census.gov/qwi/all
You only need to download the data if you wish to process the code from start to finish. Otherwise, you already have the final datasets created from the QWI.
If you choose to download, you will go through 4 iterations: 
1.)

- Industry Detail --> 4-digit industries; Other Firm Characteristics --> Firm Age, Private Ownership
- No Worker Characteristics Detail
- Indicator Categories --> emp frm* hir* sep*
- Quarters --> I choose to start from 2017Q1 to present.
